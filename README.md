# Bin Packing Custom Theory

A Custom Theory for the mobile game [Exponential Idle](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/), the API and samples that helped create this come from [here](https://github.com/conicgames/theory-sdk)
To see the theory in game enter this link after pressing the '+' icon in the Custom Theory tab: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gen1Code/Bin-Packing/main/BP.js

The CT is based on the traditional [Bin Packing Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem).
Bin Packing is where different sized items are fitted into bins of specific sizes, strategies are used to minimise the amount of bins filled.
